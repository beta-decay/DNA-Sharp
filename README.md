# DNA-Sharp

A Python interpreter for the esoteric language DNA#.

## Usage

Run the program by typing the following command:

    python3 dnaint.py [filename]

Where the filename is a valid .dna program.

## Programming

The interpreter accepts programs in both line form and helix form. At the moment (subject to change), it does not support symbol form.

*Note:* This many not work as DNA# was intended to due to it being an interpretation of the rather confusing specification.
